DESCRIPTION:\
Leaf Classification is a system in which different Machine learning classification algorithms were applied and the model with the highest accuracy is predicted. We have collected 48 different species of leaves.

A dataset was created using the extracted features to train and test the model. 

MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS:\
Naive Bayes- 65%\
Decision  Tree- 5%\
KNN- 76%\
Random forest-78%\
SVM-71%

RESULT:\
Random Forest has the highest accuracy and hence it can be used for leaf classification.
