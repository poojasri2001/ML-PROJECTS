OBJECTIVE:\
Our main objective of this project to rethink and design an advanced high performing 
machine learning model to predict fraudulent credit card transactions.

APPROACH:\
In this present work we have implemented 4 machine learning algorithms- Decision Tree, 
Random Forest, XGBoost and Logistic regression. With respect to performance metrics like 
accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and ROC-AUC curve of the above-mentioned algorithms, we 
need to analyse their outcome and predict the algorithm with the best outcome. Our dataset is 
a highly imbalanced dataset which states that either fraudulent or non-fraudulent transactions 
are higher than the other. This imbalanced dataset has to be handled precisely so that it will not 
be error-prune. The techniques which have been used to handle the imbalanced dataset are
Oversampling, SMOTE, AdaSyn. This present work tries to handle the imbalanced dataset with 
these above-mentioned techniques and build the models with the above mentioned 4 machine 
learning algorithms.
