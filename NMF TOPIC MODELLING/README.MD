NMF TOPIC MODELLING:\
Topic modeling is an unsupervised machine learning technique that’s capable of 
scanning a set of documents, detecting word and phrase patterns within them, and 
automatically clustering word groups and similar expressions that best 
characterize a set of documents. Extracting topics is a good unsupervised data mining technique to discover the underlying relationships between texts. There 
are many different approaches with the most popular probably being LDA but I’m 
going to focus on NMF.
Non-Negative Matrix Factorization is a statistical method that helps us to reduce 
the dimension of the input corpora or corpora.
